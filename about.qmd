title: "About me"
---

1.  I only believe in information that is backed by concrete research evidence and sound journalism.

    If someone tells me about a fact, I will check Google Scholar/Research Gate for a credible research paper, then check the references of that research paper until I read the original research.

2.  After living in the heart of Europe for more than 1 year, I have become very mindful of my consumption habits as they impact the environment, and I am now a minimalist.

3.  My greatest achievement so far: the strong bond I have with my family members.
