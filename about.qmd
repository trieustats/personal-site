title: "About me"
---

1.  I only believe in information that is backed by concrete research evidence and sound journalism.

    If someone tells me about a fact, I will check Google Scholar for a credible research paper, then check the references of that research paper until I read the original research.

2.  I believe the success of an individual often owes much to the support from their family, the nurturing environment in which they were raised, and the financial advantages they may have had.

3.  After living in the heart of Europe for more than 1 year, I have become very mindful of my consumption habits as they impact the environment, and I am now a minimalist.

4.  My greatest achievement so far: the strong bond I have with my family members.
