title: "About me"
---

1.  I only believe in information that is backed by concrete research evidence and sound journalism.

    If someone tells me about a research fact, I will check Google Scholar for the research paper, and check the references of the research paper until I read the original report.

2.  Having an older sister residing in the States, I've been introduced to the Americans' athletic sense as well as their embrace of diversity and inclusion.

    After living in the heart of Europe for more than 1 year, I have become very mindful of my consumption habits as they impact the environment, and I am now a minimalist.

3.  My greatest achievement so far: I have a healthy and strong relationship with my family members.
