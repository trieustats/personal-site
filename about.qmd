title: "About me"

<b> Let's see if we are alike: </b>

1. I love cats, a lot. I cannot help myself when they are around. They simply look so cute and I just want to touch their fur! 

2. Sport wise, I have a black belt in Taekwondo, so don't mess with me :P Recently I just joined a half marathon. 

3. I frequently play the piano. You can check out my humble Youtube channel on the top right corner. I don't upload a lot of videos by the way. The most recent piece I play is "Story of you" of Alexis Ffrench - a very beautiful and peaceful piece.
