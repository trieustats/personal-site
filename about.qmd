My name is Trieu Le.
I'm currently a master's student at KU Leuven.
I'm passionate about...

Recently, I've been learning R...

```{r}
a <- 1:4
b <- 5:8
a + b
a * b
```

I'm from Vung Tau city, a peninsula in the south of Viet Nam.

```{r}
#| column: screen

library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  setView(lng = 107.08, lat = 10.36, zoom = 12.4) 
```
