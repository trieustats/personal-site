    "text": "I love finding out the source of any information that I heard of. I only believe in information that is backed by concrete research evidence and sound journalism. I am learning to be aware of the possible caveats of a fact as well.\nHaving an older sister residing in the States, I’ve been introduced to the Americans’ athletic sense as well as their embrace of diversity and inclusion.\nAfter living in the heart of Europe for more than 1 year, I have become very mindful of my consumption habits as they impact the environment, and I am now a minimalist. I also learned to overcome the prejudice I have as a Vietnamese girl and respect others despite differences.\nI love meeting people from different corners of the world, seeing their perspective about life, how they think and behave because of how they were brought up.\nMy greatest achievement so far: I have a healthy and strong relationship with my family members.\n\nI am still on the way to be a global citizen. To all fellow voyagers in this grand expedition called life, I extend an open invitation. Reach out, connect, let’s unravel the threads of our experiences and weave a tapestry that reflects the beauty of our collective journey!"

I am an ambassador of cultural exchange, a seeker of harmony in diversity. I weave my heritage into conversations, and I am very proud of being a Vietnamese.\nEach day, I stride forward, fueled by the spirit of Hải Triều - the unyielding determination to surge ahead, to shape a world where the ebb and flow of ideas create a symphony of progress for me.\nEvery encounter is a chance to share, to listen and to learn."
