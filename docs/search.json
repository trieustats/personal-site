They simply look so cute and I just want to touch their fur!\nSport wise, I have a black belt in Taekwondo, so don’t mess with me 😝 Recently, I joined my first half marathon and it was fascinating. I got to meet many new people who share the same interest of running.\nI frequently play the piano. You can check out my small Youtube channel on the top right corner. I don’t upload a lot of videos by the way 😅"
