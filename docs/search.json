They simply look so cute and I just want to touch their fur!\nSport wise, I have a black belt in Taekwondo, so don’t mess with me :P Recently I just joined a half marathon.\nI frequently play the piano. You can check out my humble Youtube channel on the top right corner. I don’t upload a lot of videos by the way. The most recent piece I play is “Story of you” of Alexis Ffrench - a very beautiful and peaceful piece."
