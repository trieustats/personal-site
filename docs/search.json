    "text": "I love finding out the source of any information that I heard of. I only believe in information that is backed by concrete research evidence and sound journalism. I am learning to be aware of the possible caveats of a fact as well.\nHaving an older sister residing in the States, I’ve been introduced to the Americans’ athletic sense as well as their embrace of diversity and inclusion.\nAfter living in the heart of Europe for more than 1 year, I have become very mindful of my consumption habits as they impact the environment, and I am now a minimalist. I also learned to overcome the prejudice I have as a Vietnamese girl and respect others despite differences.\nI love meeting people from different corners of the world, seeing their perspective about life, how they think and behave because of how they were brought up.\nMy greatest achievement so far: I have a healthy and strong relationship with my family members.\n\nI am still on the way to be a global citizen.\nFeel free to reach out to me!"
