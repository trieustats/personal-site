    "text": "My name is Lê Hải Triều (Trieu Le), and it means tidal waves~\nWhen I was small, I was teased for having such a boyish name but little did I know that it was a very unique and rare name for a Vietnamese girl.\nWhy do I call myself “uttonio”? I was supposed to be the last one born in my family, and my parents expected a son. However, I was a girl, and my mom and dad just\nHere are a few facts about me:\n\nI’m currently a Master’s student at KU Leuven. I major in International Business Economics and Management.\nI love cats, a lot. I cannot help myself when they are around. They simply look so cute and I just want to touch their fur!\nI was born in Vung Tau, a lovely beach city in Vietnam. It is romantic in a certain way, and the atmosphere is excellent for outdoor activities, which is perfect for an amateur runner like me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have a black belt in Taekwondo, so don’t mess with me :P\nI am musically intelligent. I can play a melody based solely on listening. I can easily accompany others when they sing. I often hum to a random song while doing house chores. I have a music-oriented Youtube channel named “uttonio”.\nI love white, beige and blue colors. I don’t like wearing black shirts since I believe it makes me look gloomy, even though I can wear all-black running clothes.\nFood-wise, I am into Vietnamese food (Pho, com tam, banh cuon, bun bo Hue, bun thit nuong, banh mi), Japanese food (sashimi, sushi, takoyaki, onigiri), Korean food (fried chicken with sauce, kimbap, tokbokki, seaweed soup), American food (egg and bacon bagel) and Thai food (Tom Yum, Pad Thai).\nI don’t like rain since it makes everything all wet.\nI have eczema, which means I cannot eat sugar, gluten or spicy food, and I cannot shower in hot water for long."
