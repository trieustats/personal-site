title: "How I stay more productive"

1.  I use ***SelfControl application*** to block my access to distracting websites such as Instagram, Tiktok and Facebook. The application is free, open-source and is really useful. Even if I restart the computer or delete the application, access to those sites will remain restricted until the designated time expires.
2.  I use ***Bitwarden*** to store my passwords and generate random passwords for random websites.
