title: "How I stay more productive"

1.  I use ***SelfControl application*** to block my access to distracting websites (Instagram, Tiktok, Facebook, etc.). The application is free and open-source. I highly recommend it! Even if you restart the computer or delete the application, access to those sites will remain restricted until the designated time expires.
2.  I use ***Bitwarden*** to store my passwords and generate random passwords for random websites.
