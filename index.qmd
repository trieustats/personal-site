Hello! I am Triều Lê, born in a beach city in Vietnam. Somehow my name means "tidal waves"~ 

I am doing a Master's in International Business Economics and Management at KU Leuven. 

Formerly, I had a Marketing job offer in the Finance sector in Vietnam but decided to decline it and pursue a Master in Belgium.

The number one skill that I want to learn at the moment is communicating effectively with people: being to-the-point, specific, understandable, concise and articulate without "and", uhm" or "ah".

For me, every encounter is a chance to share and to learn.

Feel free to be in touch! Thanks for stopping by.
