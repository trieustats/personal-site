Hi! This is Tri·ªÅu. Thanks for stopping by! I am doing a Master's in International Business Economics and Management at KU Leuven, Belgium.

Three values that I am known for: detail-oriented, honest and ethical.

For me, every encounter is a chance to share and to learn.

**Feel free to be in touch with me!**
