I am doing a Master's in International Business Economics and Management at KU Leuven, Belgium.

Formerly, I had a Marketing job offer in the Finance sector in Vietnam. I decided to decline it and pursue a Master in Belgium because I really wanted to see the world.

The number one skill that I want to learn at the moment is communicating effectively with people: being to-the-point, specific, understandable, concise, articulate and polite without "and", uhm" or "ah".

For me, every encounter is a chance to share and to learn.
