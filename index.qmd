I entered this world in Vũng Tàu - a beautiful beach city in Vietnam. 

My name, Hải Triều, means "tidal waves"~

I am pursuing a Master's in International Business Economics and Management at KU Leuven, being a world away from the tranquil shores of my homeland. 

Here, in the heart of Europe, I am not merely a student. I am an ambassador of cultural exchange, a seeker of harmony in diversity. 

For me, every encounter is a chance to share and to learn.
