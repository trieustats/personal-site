Hi! This is Tri·ªÅu. Thanks for stopping by!

I am doing a Master's in International Business Economics and Management at KU Leuven, Belgium.

The number one skill that I want to learn at the moment is communicating effectively with people: being to-the-point, specific, understandable, concise, articulate and polite.

For me, every encounter is a chance to share and to learn.

**Feel free to be in touch with me!**
